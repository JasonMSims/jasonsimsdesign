When I started my career as a freelance graphic designer, I quickly realized I needed a website. I've always wanted to build things myself and understand how they tick - and this was no exception. I dove head first into learning how to build a website, and that marked a huge mindset shift for me as I realized that code can **_&mdash; and should &mdash;_** be beautifully and intentionally designed too.

Fast-forward several years, and I have had the privilege of working with and for several great organizations, including [NCR Voyix](https://www.ncr.com/banking), where I designed responsive websites for a number of financial institutions, focusing on accessibility and user experience.

Currently, I thrive on solving complex challenges as a software engineer in the e-commerce space, where I develop innovative solutions to optimize processes, eliminate friction, and drive growth.

I'm self-taught, always learning, and always growing. If I don't know how to do something yet, I'll figure it out!

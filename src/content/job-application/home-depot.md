Thank you for taking the time to look at my application and resume! I really appreciate it.

## I'm Jason Sims

I am a software engineer living in metro Atlanta. I was born and raised in Georgia, so I've been in this area my whole life.

## My Story

I have always had an artistic bent. As a kid, I drew all the time. As I got older, that moved more towards graphic design and &mdash; as a result of necessity &mdash; that shifted to website design.

Although I planned to pursue a degree in Website Design, life took a different turn. My wife and I married young and quickly welcomed our first son, so I chose to jump straight into full-time work to support our young and growing family.

Thankfully, I've always had a solid work ethic that has been instilled in me since childhood. I believe no job is beneath me, and I'm always ready to hustle and grind and &mdash; at the same time &mdash; I believe no job is out of reach with enough determination and hard work.

This is why my resume includes my entire work history &mdash; even the roles that might seem unrelated at first glance. Each experience has shaped who I am today, presenting challenges and opportunities that I tackled head-on and grew through as I have continued to advance my career.

Despite not having a formal education in software development, I continued to hone my skills in website design and development. I landed a role as a website designer at NCR Voyix, where I quickly became a key contributor to the team.

A couple of years later, I took on a position at Plethora7, an eCommerce company where I currently work as a software engineer. Here, I've had the opportunity to develop custom systems integrations, such as reporting dashboards that interact with Amazon's Selling Partner API, architect and maintain MySQL, Postgres, and MongoDB databases, build first-party eCommerce websites, and implement a full ERP system for the business.

## Why I Think We Would Be a Great Fit

- **I am ready to face new challenges and grow.** I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to a world-class company like Home Depot.
- **I'm a fast learner.** While some applicants may have more formal education or experience, you won't find anyone who is more committed to learning, growing, and exceeding expectations than me.
- **I'm teachable and able to teach.** Show me the right way to do something once, and I’ll internalize it, apply it, and be ready to teach it to others.
- **I'm a team player.** I love working with others to solve problems and build out solutions. I'm not afraid to ask questions or to ask for help when I need it. And I don't hesitate to speak up and contribute my thoughts and insights when I believe they can add value.
